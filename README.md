To execute the code simply enter the command ./apolo, if you want to compile the command it must be gcc -o apolo apolo.c -fopenmp.
I used OpenMP to parallelize the matrix initialization and matrix multiplication cycles, and I also used pointers to better manage memory access.
My respository is already cloned in Apolo, in case you want to run it in Apolo, you should do a pull and reorganize the directories, and compile again to be sure that it is working well.
